# scene 4 Back at Rai's house in her room with Mia

label house:

      rai "I bet if I hooked this up with my raspberry pi I could make it move. But what should it do?"

      mia "I can bake a raspberry pie, bit how would that make it move?"

      rai "Not that kind of pie! A P-I pi. It's like a little computer."

      mia "Oh. Well, since it's a single hand, maybe you can teach it to play solitaire."

      rai "That's a great idea! I'm glad I thought of it!"

      rai "You know the science fair is tomorrow, can you do it by then?"

      "..."

      mia "Can I help?"

      "..."

      mia "I'll get some energy drinks, it sounds like it will be a long night."
