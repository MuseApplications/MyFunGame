      rai "I better check the mail before mom starts nagging... Oh, there's a letter for my neighbor Jacqueline in here."

      rai "I'm a little nervous going up to her door. When we were growing up, exeryone said she was a witch. She didn't have a job, and rarely left the house. I don't know if she even has a job. I've seen her leave the house maybe two or three times, ever."

      rai "But I don't believe in witches.  That's just what you call old ladies who don't act normal. When I grow up, everyone will probably think I'm a witch."

      rai "Next to the door is a gloved hand attached to the wall. I reached for it and it grabbed my hand, shook it, and said \"welcome\". Off in the distance, a gong sounded."

      rk "Curse that mailman, he's always making mistakes! Next time I'm going to sic my mechanical dog on him."

      rai "You,"

      rai "You, you,"

      rai "You, you, you have a mechanical dog?"

      rk "Doesn't everyone? Would you like to meet her?"

      rk "Erector! Erector come down and meet this young lady."

      rai "I'm [rai], by the way. And her name is Erector?"

      rk "Yes, I built her when I was your age with an Erector set I stole from my brother. Of course, I didn't add the motorized stuff until I was in college."

      rai "I love your doorbell, did you create that?"

      rk "Yes, my specialty is mechanical hands, would you like one? It doesn't actually do anything."
