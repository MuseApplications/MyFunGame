Tries karaoke - She thinks she sounds pretty good when she gets applause. But then (Yugyfoog) gets up to sing and the audience cheers louder. She thinks damn I should have picked another song.

*make the rkamradtsr character an old woman to avoid the typical absent minded professor stereotype (rk)*

*yugyfoog's invention is a volcano that blows up in the judge's faces (rk)*

*what if yugyfoog congratulates rai and then launches into a deep psychological explanation as to why he is the way he is, only to be interrupted either by rai or some event, revealing that nobody cares (rai)*
