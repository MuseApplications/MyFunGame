## Scene 3 J'acqueline's house

### Panel 3.1 Rai at the mailbox
One day when I was checking the mail, there was a letter for our neighbor accidentally in ours

### Panel 3.2 Rai in front of J'acqueline's house
I was a little nervous going up to the door. When we were growing up we all said she was a witch. 
She didn't have a job, and rarely left the house.

### Panel 3.3 Rai in front of the door
But I don't believe it witches, that's just what you call old ladies who don't act normal. When I
grow up, everyone will probably think I'm a witch

### Panel 3.4 Rai shaking hands with the mechanical hand
Next to the door was a gloved hand attached to the wall. I put my hand up to it and it grabbed my hand,
shook it, and said 'welcome' Off in the distance a gong sounded.

### Panel 3.5 Rai handing J'acqueline her box
Curse that mailman, he's always making mistakes! Next time I'm going to sic my mechanical dog on him

You, you, you have a mechanical dog?

Doesn't everyone? Would you like to meet her?

My name is Rai, her name is Erector?

### Panel 3.10 J'acqueline with a welding mask on welding something in the corner
Yes, I built her when I was your age with an Erector set I stole from my brother. Of course
I didn't add the motorized stuff until I was in college.

### Panel 3.11 Rai looking over J'acqueline's workbench
I love your doorbell, did you create that? 

### Panel 3.11 J'acqueline giving Rai a mechanical hand
Yes, my specialty is mechanical hands, would you like one? It doesn't actually do anything.

## Scene 4 Back at Rai's house in her room with Maria Rosa

### Panel 4.1 Rai staring at the mechanical hand
I bet if I hooked this up with my raspberry pi I could make it move. But what should it do?

### Panel 4.2 Maria Rosa
I can bake a raspberry pie, but how would that make it move?

### Panel 4.3 Rai 
Not that kind of pie! a P-I pi. It's like a little computer

### Panel 4.4 Maria Rosa looking embarrassed.
Oh. Well, since it's a single hand, maybe you can teach it to play solitaire

### Panel 4.5 Rai with a light bulb over her head
That's a great idea! I'm glad I thought of it!

### Panel 4.6 Maria Rosa looking a little angry
You know the science fair is tomorrow, can you do it by then

### Panel 4.7 Rai busy connecting wires
...

### Panel 4.8 Maria Rosa
Can I help

I'll get some energy drinks, it sounds like it will be a long night.

This will never work! the machanical hand can't move the cards around!

### Panel 5.2 Maria Rosa with a light bulb
How about if I sew it some gloves made of vinyl? You know how you always
stick to vinvy furniture

### Panel 5.3 Rai with her head on her desk
Sure, what can it hurt?

## Scene 6 Science Fair

As soon as the pressure from the magma is high enough KABLOOEY!

### Panel 6.3 The volcano explodes and gets goop all over Yugyfoog and the judges
...

### Panel 6.4 Yugyfoog starts crying
My parents forced me to do this! they want me to become a scientist like my big brother. But I just 
want to be a ballet dancer. But men are repressed and expected to to man things I'm just a victim
of scociety

You just wait until the ballet competition next month! You'll see! They all said I was crazy, but I'll show all of you

### Panel 6.13 J'acqueline leans down to Rai and Maria Rosa's level
You two should join me as inventors! I can do the mechanical stuff well enough, but all these computers ands stuff makes my head spin

### Panel 6.14 Rai looks up at J'acqueline
Wow, do you really need us? I thought you were expert at everything

### Panel 6.15 J'acqueline laughs
No one is expert at everything! Now I expect you two to help me on my next project, a robotic vacuum!

### Panel 6.16 Rai and Maria Rosa laugh
There's already a robotic vacuum!

### Panel 6.17 J'acqueline smiles
Yes, but mine also does counters, sinks, windows, and toilets.
