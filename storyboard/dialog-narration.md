# Life of Ruby

## Scene 1 introductions

### Panel 1.1 picture of Ruby 
Hi, I'm Ruby. I'm a normal teenager

### Panel 1.2 picture of Ruby contemplative
Well...not so normal. I like electronics and computers

### Panel 1.3 picture of boys and girls hanging out 
All my friends like to hang out with boys

### Panel 1.4 picture of Ruby looking down
Actually, they're not really my friends

### Panel 1.5 picture of Mia looking at Ruby, just smiling, eyes looking down
This is my only real friend, Mia 

##################### Panel 1.6 Picture of broken down electronics and computers
Most of my electronic projects don't work. But my mom bought me a Raspberry Pi for my birthday. I'm gonna try and make something really cool (with it. - MK) (Not sure what, though. - RK)

## Scene 2 Bowling

################################################# Panel 2.1 picture of John
This is (Change to That's - MK) my tormentor, John. He's good at everything and likes to show off.

### Panel 2.2 picture of the team bowling
Like the time we went bowling and John got almost all strikes

########################################## Panel 2.3 picture of John bowling
But he did two gutter balls so Angelica the lead cheerleader would win (But he threw two gutter balls just so Angelica could win - MK) ((He threw two gutter balls just so Angelica could win...) - RK)

### Panel 2.4 picture of Ruby bowling
I mostly fell on my butt. I don't know why I tried bowling, I'm pretty terrible at sports.

## Scene 2.5 karaoke

#################################### Panel 2.6 picture of gym set up for karaoke
And that (Another - MK) (This other - RK) time at the karaoke contest, I sang my heart out and got lots of applause.

### Panel 2.7 picture of John singing in a spotlight
But then John brought down the house

############################################## Panel 2.8 picture of Ruby singing
I really thought I could out do (outdo - RK) him, so I sang again. But I picked a song that was too high for my alto range.

### Panel 2.9 picture of audience staring blankly
Only Mia clapped, and even she stopped when she noticed no one else was clapping.

### Panel 2.10 picture of Ruby looking dejected still in the spotlight
So that's my life as a failure.

## Scene 3 Jacqueline's house

### Panel 3.0 Black
After school

### Panel 3.1 Ruby at the mailbox
I better check the mail before mom starts nagging...
Oh, there's a letter for Jacqueline in here.

################################## Panel 3.2 Ruby in front of Jacqueline's house
I'm a little nervous going up to her door. When we were growing up, we all (everyone - Mk) said (the neighborhood boys swore - RK) she was a witch. 
She didn't have a job, and rarely left the house. (Remove this sentence - RK)
I don't know if she even has a job. I've seen her leave the house maybe two or three times, ever.

### Panel 3.3 Ruby in front of the door
But I don't believe in witches. That's just what you call old ladies who don't act normal. When I grow up, everyone will probably think I'm a witch.

########################## Panel 3.31 Ruby in front of the door
Next to the door was (is - RK) a gloved hand attached to the wall. I put my hand up to it (reached for it. - MK) 


######################### Panel 3.4 Ruby shaking hands with the mechanical hand
and it grabbed my hand,
shook it, and said 'welcome'. (It grabbed my hand!!!!! Oh, it's shaking it. That's... okay. 

######################### Panel 3.41 Ruby shaking hands with the mechanical hand
Welcome.

######################### Panel 3.4 Ruby shaking hands with the mechanical hand
(Wut. - RK) Off in the distance, a gong sounded. 

###################################### Panel 3.5 Ruby handing Jacqueline her box
Curse that mailman, he's always making mistakes (he's always giving my mail to everyone but me - MK)! Next time I'm going to sic my mechanical dog on him.

############################################# Panel 3.6 Ruby looking amazed
You, you, you (You... you - RK) have a mechanical dog?

### Panel 3.7 J'acqueline looking slightly annoyed
Doesn't everyone? Would you like to meet her?

### Panel 3.8 Interiour of J'acqueline's house filled with odd contraptions
Erector! Erector come down and meet this young lady.

### Panel 3.9 Rai playing with a mechanical dog (with Jacqueline already at her workbench nearby -RK)
I'm Ruby, by the way. And her name is Erector?

### Panel 3.10 J'acqueline with a welding mask on welding something in the corner (note: this panel is unnecessary. Put this dialogue in the Panel 3.11 -RK)
Yes, I built her when I was your age with an Erector set I stole from my brother. Of course,
I didn't add the motorized stuff until I was in college.

################ Panel 3.11 Rai looking over J'acqueline's workbench (ditto -RK)
I love (liked -RK) your doorbell, did you create that? 

### Panel 3.11 J'acqueline giving Rai a mechanical hand (ditto -RK)
Yes, my specialty is mechanical hands, would you like one? It doesn't actually do anything.

### Panel 3.12
Sure!

## Scene 4 Back at Ruby's house in her room with Mia

### Panel 4.1 Ruby staring at the mechanical hand
I bet if I hooked this up with my raspberry pi I could make it move. But what should it do?

### Panel 4.2 Mia
I can bake a raspberry pie, but how would that make it move?

### Panel 4.3 Ruby 
Not that kind of pie! a P-I pi. It's like a little computer

### Panel 4.4 Mia looking embarrassed.
Oh. Well, since it's a single hand, maybe you can teach it to play solitaire

### Panel 4.5 Ruby with a light bulb over her head
That's a great idea! I'm glad I thought of it!

### Panel 4.6 Mia looking a little angry (dejected - MK)
You know the science fair is tomorrow, can you do it by then?

### Panel 4.7 Rai busy connecting wires
...

### Panel 4.8 Mia
Can I help?

### Panel 4.10 repeat of Panel 4.7
...

### Panel 4.11 Maria Rosa
I'll get some energy drinks, it sounds like it will be a long night.

## Scene 5 Early morning in Rai's bedroom

### Panel 5.1 Rai looking frustrated
This will never work! the mechanical hand can't move the cards around!

### Panel 5.2 Maria Rosa with a light bulb
Maybe I can sew it a glove made of vinyl. You know how you always
stick to vinyl furniture? And I could sew a sleeve with the same material I used to make this top!

######################################## Panel 5.3 Rai with her head on her desk
Sure, what can it hurt? (let's give it a shot. -RK)

### Panel 5.4 Pictured from above, Rai alone in her room next to the mechanical hand

### Panel 5.5 Mia rushing in sweating holding up a glove
I made this as quick as I could! I think the sleeve is pretty!

### Panel 5.6 Rai and Mia stare amazed at the gloved hand moving the cards around
...

## Scene 6 Science Fair

### Panel 6.1 Yugyfoog next to his baking soda volcano with a diagram of the insides of a volcano
I bet no one ever thought of this!

### Panel 6.2 The judges approach and eye his volcano suspiciously. Yugyfood holds the detonator button
As soon as the pressure from the magma is high enough KABLOOEY! (The volcano explodes and gets goop all over John and the judges. - RK)

### Panel 6.3 There's goop all over Yugyfoog and the judges
...

######################################################## Panel 6.4 Ruby's table
Oh no, here are the judges. Okay Ruby, time to show them what you're made of.

######################################### Panel 6.5 Ruby's table
I turn on the switch. The mechanical hand whirs into action and everyone stands back silently as it flips over the cards and moves them around.


###################################### Panel 6.6 Ruby's table
Everyone is applauding! Wow, ok thank god. Still got a few bugs to work out...

####################################### Panel 6.7 Blue ribbon
Hot damn, I even got the blue ribbon!!

###################################### Panel 6.7 Ruby's table, John approaches
Hey Ruby, congrats on your win.

###################################### Panel 6.8 Ruby's table
Oh, thanks--

###################################### Panel 6.9 Ruby's table
You know, I think we got off on the wrong foot. I find your scrappy approach admirable. I just couldn't admit it because I have a type-A, perfect--did I say perfect? I meant perfectionist--personality. 

###################################### Panel 6.10 Ruby's table
Every man in my family for the last four generations has held valedictorian at this high school, and captain of the water polo team, AND decathalon president. It's quite a lot of pressure for a young, vigorous man like me, and...

####################################### Panel 6.11 John's table
Suddenly John's volcano erupts again! It looks like Ms. Gupta, our principal, got gooped. He rushes over to apologize.

####################################### Panel 6.12 Ruby's table, Mia appears
I wasn't sure how to rescue you, so I put more baking soda in the volcano.

####################################### Panel 6.13 Ruby's table
A national hero.

#################################### Panel 6.14 Ruby's table, Jaqueline appears
I see you put my mechanical hand to good use.

####################################### Panel 6.15 Ruby's table
Yes, ma'am!

####################################### Panel 6.16 Ruby's table
And the glove? You did this as well?

####################################### Panel 6.17 Ruby's table, Ruby grinning
As a matter of fact--

####################################### Panel 6.18 Ruby's table, Mia dejected
...

####################################### Panel 6.19 Ruby's table
I'm kidding, I'm kidding! Go on, tell her.

####################################### Panel 6.20 Ruby's table
It-- it was me, ma'am.


####################### Panel 6.13 J'acqueline leans down to Rai and Mia's level
Okay, no more of this ma'am nonsense. You two should join me as inventors! I can do the mechanical stuff well enough, but all these computers and stuff (change stuff to electronic crap - MK) make my head spin

### Panel 6.14 Rai looks up at J'acqueline
Wow, do you really need us? I thought you were an expert at everything.

############################################ Panel 6.15 J'acqueline laughs
No one is an expert at everything! Now I expect you two to help me on my next project, (: - RK) a robotic vacuum!

########################################### Panel 6.16 Rai and Mia laugh
(But - RK) there's already a robotic vacuum!

### Panel 6.17 J'acqueline smiles (winks? - MK)
Yes, but mine also does counters, sinks, windows, and toilets.

## Scene 7 Epilogue

### Panel 7.1 J'acqueline, Rai, and Mia sipping drinks on a veranda on a tropic island
*The End*
