# July 18-26 (Writing team woo! This will work nicely because the game jam doesn’t officially start until the 27th.)
⁃ Write story outline
⁃ Write characters descriptions
⁃ Write setting descriptions
⁃ If the above three are done, write the rough draft of the story
⁃ I’ll go over anything you upload on Atom

# July 27-August 2
⁃ Create character art (I’ll draft by pencil, dad and Mary finish on the computer)
⁃ Create background art (team effort— we’ll more clearly divvy up this work when the time comes and we know what we need.)
⁃ Create layout (me)
⁃ Add sample transitions (Dad)
⁃ Gather songs and sound effect (me. Dad and Mary, feel free to send suggestions!)
⁃ Create sample game from outline/draft and everything compiled thus far (programming team)
⁃ Write final version of the story (writing team)

# August 3-August 9 9:00 p.m. PST 
⁃ Input final version of the story into the game (programming team)
⁃ Finalize character art, background art, layout, transitions, and songs and sound effects.
⁃ Test game and work out any bugs (programming team + willing victims)
