I'm sorry, but an uncaught exception occurred.

While running game code:
  File "game/script.rpy", line 20, in script
    "You are standing at the end of a road before a small brick building. Around you is a forest. A small stream flows out of the building and down a gully."
  File "renpy/common/000window.rpy", line 98, in _window_auto_callback
    _window_show()
  File "renpy/common/000window.rpy", line 60, in _window_show
    renpy.with_statement(trans)
IOError: Couldn't find file '02 - Away, No Way.mp3'.
